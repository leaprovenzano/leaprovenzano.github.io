title: I've written my first Codewars Kata!
---

While i've been an obsessive user of Codewars for a while now, I had never created my own katas - only translated them.

This kata takes advantage of Generators in Javascript ES6 to create a combinations generator similar to that in Python's itertools.
I have to say I'm pretty proud...

Feel free to [check it out](https://www.codewars.com/kata/like-itertools-combinations)!
